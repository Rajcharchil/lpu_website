			<h2>About Disaster Management at LPU Campus</h2>
			<p>Disaster management at LPU Campus for sustainable development is a comprehensive approach that aims to reduce the impact of disasters on students, faculty, and staff. The approach involves a range of activities, including prevention, preparedness, response, and recovery.</p>

		<section id="prevention">
			<h2>Prevention</h2>
			<p>Prevention is the key to reducing the impact of disasters on campus. At LPU, we take a proactive approach to disaster management, which involves identifying potential risks and hazards, and taking steps to mitigate them. This includes regular inspections and maintenance of infrastructure, as well as training and awareness campaigns for students, faculty, and staff.</p>

		<section id="response">
			<h2>Response</h2>
			<p>When a disaster does occur, it is important to have an effective response plan in place. At LPU, we have a dedicated team of first responders who are trained to respond quickly and efficiently to any emergency situation. We also have a range of emergency supplies and equipment on hand to help us manage the aftermath of a disaster.</p>
		</section>

		<section id="recovery">
			<h2>Recovery</h2>
			<p>After a disaster, it is important to focus on recovery and rebuilding. At LPU, we work closely with the local community and government to ensure a coordinated and effective recovery effort. This involves providing support and resources to those who have been affected by the disaster, as well as working to rebuild and restore the campus and surrounding areas.</p>
